\section{Basic Information about Russian}
Russian is a Slavic language spoken by 155 million persons primarily in Russia and former Soviet Union republics (Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, \ldots), making it the 8th most spoken language in the world. Russian is written using a 33-letter alphabet inherited from the Cyrillic alphabet. Its orthography has been standardised progressively until the 1917 reform which is still is use today. From the point of view of morphology, Russian can be categorized as fusional and exhibits phenomena similar to those present in other Indo-European languages: declension of nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals, conjugation of verbs.
